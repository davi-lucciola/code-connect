### Images

1. `<img>` X `<Image />`

> Default next `<Image />` component in next js optimizes the images loading by serving the correctly image size for each device and cast the image format to Webp ()

2. External images needs to be allowed (for external hosts)

> When we using external images with next `<Image />` component, we have to allow the host in the `next.config.js` to import this images. That measure assure more security in your frontend.
